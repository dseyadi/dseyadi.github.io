<p>Sharm El-Shaik, Egypt was one of my most recent vacation destinations. Because of the Corona Virus,
 this holiday was little unusual. Many establishments were closed, so we had no choice but to stay put.
 Nonetheless, we had a fabulous time.</p>

<h3>About Sharm El-Shaikh</h3>
<p>If you love the sea, then Sharm El-Shaikh is your destination. The sheltered sandy beaches, beautiful water,
 and coral reefs of Sharm are well-known. Because you will be spending most of your time at your resort, 
 it is critical that you select the finest spot for you.</p>

<div id="Resort" class="col-12">
<p>During our visit we stayed at <ins>two different resort</ins> which are:</p>

<dd>It's a beautiful family resort with a private beach where you can enjoy the beauty of the Red Sea, swimming pools,
 restaurants, shuttle service, a spa, and much more. <br/> There are numerous activities to choose from.</dd>
 
 <ul>
 <li>Kayaking, paddling, scuba diving, snorkeling, and whatever else comes to mind when it comes to <i><strong>water pleasure and adventure</strong></i>.</li>
 <li>Table tennis, darts, billiards, tennis court, and chess field are some of the <i><strong>sports and leisure activities available</strong></i>.</li>
 <li>Enjoying a daily live show for both kids and adults at various times is an example of <i><strong>the entertainment</strong></i> that they offer.</li>

<dd>Because it's not allowed for children under the age of <i>13</i> to enter several areas of the hotel, it's more of <strong> a friend trip hotel. </strong>
However, the hotel location was ideal since it was on <ins>Soho square</ins>, which hosted concerts, stores, and even matches. The style of the rooms,
 as well as the swimming pools, made the hotel stand out.</dd>

<dt><ins>Private boat trip</ins></dt>
<dd>It is a day trip to <strong><i>Ras Mohammed</i></strong>, one of Sharm El-Shaikh Island's where you may swim, snorkel, and scuba dive. So, I had the chance to go scuba diving
 and believe me when I say that even if the ocean is your greatest fear, you must go scuba diving here. It was a wonderful opportunity for me to step outside
 of my comfort zone and experience that incredible experience.</dd>

<strong>a small man-made cave</strong> where we witnessed a live show that included traditional Egyptian dances such as the <ins>tanoura</ins> as well as a fire show, on the end of the 
night we returned to the ATVs to the area and headed back to the resort.</dd>

<dd>One of the best places to visit is Farsha café which is a cafe <i><strong>in the Highlands</strong></i>. It was designed up of little, intricate details. Each has its own story to tell.
 We could see the sea, which provided a spectacular perspective. The weather was also fantastic. Which made it a great day to relax.</dd>
