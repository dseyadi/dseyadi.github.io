<p>My family and I can all agree that our trip to <i>Munich,Germany</i> was memorable.
 At the time of our vacation, the weather in Germany was exceptionally exciting.
 We'd get up and go on walks down our block, taking great shots. </p>

<p>Germany is a member of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, which means that you can travel 
between <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries without crossing a border or needing a passport. 
So renting a car and going on a road trip is a brilliant idea, and that is exactly what we did.</p>
<p>We were staying in a location that bordered France. As a result, we decided to go on a family road
 trip there. We took a trip to this charming little French village called <ins>Colmar</ins>. There were a few modest
 eateries and shops there. That was unquestionably a remarkable day.</p>

<dd>Marienplatz has been the geographical and cultural heart of Munich since 1158. The city square is home to important buildings like the Old and New Town Halls. <cite>(civitatis Munich,2021, online)</cite>
<br/> Walking in Marienplatz square feels like running through Munich history. Marienplatz today is encompassed by some of the city's most iconic places of attractions. 
<br/> <h4><abbr title="New Town Hall">Neues Rathaus</abbr></h4> <br/>
That contains hundreds of <em>statues, arches, and a tower. </em> The tower is well-known for its famous clock, which lets people from all around the world gather in front of the New Town Hall just to talk a shot at the New Town Hall clock.
